# meta-ios-projects

ðŸ‘‹ **Hello there!**

I'm excited to share that I've applied for the Meta iOS Developer Professional Certificate, and as part of my learning journey, I'll be posting all my coursework projects here on this GitHub Repo. This space serves as a showcase of my skills and the projects I've worked on during the course.

I want to clarify that these projects are intended solely for the purpose of displaying my progress and capabilities. My goal is to create a portfolio that reflects my dedication and growth as an iOS developer. I genuinely don't intend to aid anyone in plagiarism or any unethical activities. 

Feel free to explore the projects, and if you have any questions or feedback, I'm more than happy to hear from you. Let's keep the learning spirit alive and thriving!

Happy coding! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
