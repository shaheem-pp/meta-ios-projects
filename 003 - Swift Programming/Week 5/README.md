#  Final project: The bank account simulator

You have encountered exercises, knowledge checks, in-video questions and other assessments as you have progressed through the course. Next, you will apply the skills and knowledge you have attained to create a bank account simulator.

The purpose of this project is to evaluate your understanding of the key learning objectives of the course you have just completed. Most importantly, the exercise will help you establish which topics you have mastered and which topics require further focus. Ultimately, the project is designed to allow you the opportunity to demonstrate what you have learned and cement your understanding of the programming fundamentals in Swift.


What to expect
You will work with functions, loops, conditional statements, switch statements, structures and classes to create the bank account simulator’s functionality. The bank account simulator’s operations are implemented with functions and grouped together in the structure of the project. The logic of the simulator uses loops to process user input and create valid bank accounts. Conditional statements and switch statements implement valid bank account operations and make sure the bank account simulator runs smoothly along the way. 

You will create a bank account simulator to:

Create valid bank accounts

Check the bank account balance

Validate withdrawals from bank accounts and deposits to bank accounts 

Ultimately, you will code a bank account simulator by creating a valid bank account and then use appropriate programming logic to manage it. You will configure the bank account simulator to check the bank account balance, validate withdrawals from the bank account and monitor deposits into the bank account. 


Individual exercises
The project is divided into three parts to ensure that you are provided with appropriate feedback and guidance along the way. You will start the project by creating the bank account, then you will define the bank account operations. Finally, you will write code to manage the bank account.


Part 1: Create the bank account
Create bank debit and credit bank account options.

Define a class and use loops to create a valid bank account based on the user’s choice.

Use switch statements to select the right type of bank account from the list of valid bank account types provided by the bank account simulator. 

Part 2: Define the bank account's operations
Configure the bank account to handle different types of operations including withdrawals and deposits.

Use structures and classes to create valid bank account operations and modularize the code of the project.

Configure conditional statements to implement the logic of withdrawals from bank accounts and deposits to bank accounts.

Part 3: Manage the bank account
Manage the bank account using the operations defined. 

Use functions to handle the bank account’s transfer logic.

Use loops to manage the bank account based on the user’s choice.

Use conditional statements to select the bank account’s operation based on the bank account’s type.

Use switch statements to choose the right bank account operation from the list of valid bank account operations provided by the bank account simulator.


Nothing in the project will be outside what you have covered already, so you should be well-placed to succeed.
